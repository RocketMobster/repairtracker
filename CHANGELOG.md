### Notes


# Admin Backend TODO
- User/role management: add admin, staff, and custom roles; restrict sensitive actions (delete, schema changes) to admins

- [TODO] Restore-to-board tool: The 'Restore to Board' link in customer details is currently a dev tool for restoring RMAs to the Kanban board. Consider gating this feature for admin use only in production, as it may be necessary for admin recovery/maintenance.
- Customizable form schemas: allow admin to edit ticket/customer form fields, types, and validation rules
	- Add admin UI page with a code/text editor (e.g., Monaco, Ace, or textarea) to edit the JSON schema for custom fields directly in the app, with live preview and validation.
	- Store the custom fields schema in app state (Zustand or backend DB), not just a static file, and persist changes from the admin UI.
	- Changes to the schema should update the ticket form instantly for all users.
	- Add schema validation in the admin UI to prevent invalid field definitions.
- Drag-and-drop form builder for ticket form:
	- Visual editor for admins to add, remove, and reorder fields (including custom fields) using drag-and-drop.
	- Each field's config (name, label, type, required, etc.) is editable in the UI.
	- On save, updates the schema in app state and persists it.
	- The ticket form (DynamicForm) always renders based on the current schema, so changes are reflected instantly.
- RMA number schema: allow client to set RMA number length (8-15), composition (numeric or alphanumeric), and first two fixed letters (prefix); expose settings in admin UI and persist for ticket creation; allow preview of RMA format
- Ticket status and workflow customization: admin can define custom ticket statuses and allowed transitions
- Add admin panel setting to toggle the comments/activity log in the Kanban card preview modal on or off for all cards in the board.
- Data export/import: CSV/Excel export for tickets/customers, import for bulk onboarding
- Audit log: track admin actions (deletes, edits, schema changes)
- Branding: allow admin to upload logo, set business info, and customize PWA appearance
- Backup/restore: admin can trigger backup and restore of all data
- Advanced search/filter: admin UI for searching/filtering tickets and customers by any field
- Localization/regional settings: admin can set default date format (e.g., mm-dd-yyyy, dd-mmm-yyyy, mm/dd/yy) and phone number format (US/UK/other) for all forms and displays; settings applied app-wide

# Other admin-controlled features discussed today:
- Schema-driven form editor: allow admin to add/remove/move date/signature/notes fields for ticket workflow steps (e.g., Reception, Inspection, Repaired, Shipped, etc.)
- Kanban board configuration: admin can enable/disable Kanban board, set default columns/statuses, and control drag/drop permissions
