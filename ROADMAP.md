# RepairTracker Pro – Project Roadmap

## Overview
RepairTracker Pro is a React + Vite + Tailwind CSS Progressive Web App (PWA) for streamlined repair tracking and returns management. It features robust customer and ticket management, a role-based system, and plugin-friendly architecture.

---

## Roadmap

### 1. Foundation & Setup
- [x] Scaffold React + Vite + Tailwind CSS project
- [x] Configure Tailwind CSS (v3 for stability)
- [x] Set up Zustand for global state management
- [x] Integrate React Router for navigation
- [x] Add vite-plugin-pwa for PWA support

### 2. Core Features: Customer & Ticket Management
### 3. Core Lists & Boards
- [ ] Searchable, alphabetized customer list page
    - Dedicated page listing all customers in alphabetical order with search and filter options.
- [ ] Global ticket list/search page
    - Page listing all tickets (active and closed), searchable by RMA number, company name, or ticket number.
- [ ] Kanban board for ticket prioritization
    - Drag-and-drop Kanban board for ticket workflow, status management, and prioritization. Enterprise-level feature for real-time ticket management.



### 3. Advanced Features

- [ ] Admin-editable field groups for ticket/customer forms and details views
    - Allow clients to define custom groupings of fields (with label, color, and order) from the admin backend for both forms and details views. This enables highly flexible, industry-specific UI layouts.

- [ ] Usage logs for admin backend
    - Secure log files are generated whenever a customer is entered (with a repair ticket/RMA number), when additional tickets/RMA numbers are added for existing customers, when customers or tickets are deleted, and when tickets or customers are edited.
    - Each log entry records the date, time, user, and operation performed.

### 4. UI/UX & PWA Polish
- [ ] Responsive, modern UI with Tailwind
- [ ] PWA manifest and icons
- [ ] Offline support and caching
- [ ] Accessibility improvements

### 5. Testing & Deployment
- [ ] Unit and integration tests
- [ ] CI/CD setup
- [ ] GitHub repository and version control
- [ ] Deployment (Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
